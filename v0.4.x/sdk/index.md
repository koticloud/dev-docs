# SDK

Koti Cloud SDK is a set of modules (tools) that are meant to make your development process easier by taking care of some common problems for you. It also helps to make all Koti Cloud apps a bit more unified.

Please read each of the following sections to have a good idea of what these modules have to offer. We encourage you to use as many modules as possible. You should, at the very least, use the `Navigator` and `DB` modules.
