# Koti Cloud Developer Documentation

This is documentation for [Koti Cloud](https://koti.cloud/) app developers.

## What is Koti Cloud?

Koti Cloud is a web platform that hosts and runs Progressive Web Apps (PWA). It is not a traditional web app hosting. It is more like a web OS which has certain requirements to its apps so that users would get more or less the same experience between apps.

## What is a Koti Cloud App?

A Koti Cloud app is essentially a PWA that is built with the help of Koti Cloud SDK, is hosted at Koti Cloud and utilizes Koti Cloud backend.

## Why Build a Koti Cloud App?

Koti Cloud apps run in the browser, so they are platform independent. You only need to make your app once and it'll run on any device under any OS. Koti Cloud apps don't need installation and can be accessed in an instant. Sharing an app is as easy as sharing a website link. Unlike traditional web apps, Koti Cloud apps work offline too.

Koti Cloud takes care of data storage and synchronization, handles app updates, provides you with some reusable frontend components.

Your users will only need a single Koti Cloud account for all their apps to get data synced between their devices.
